# Astrochicken Trilogy Plan

I'm not a very good games programmer, so let's do this across multiple individual projects so that coding patterns and conventions can emerge and solidify over the course of developing the whole series.

## Astrochicken 1: Sol

Astrochickens are independent entities capable of self-replication and self-improvement. Corporations build them to mine the other cosmic bodies in humanity's native solar system. You are one such astrochicken.

### Explore with full orbital physics!

Zoom around every planet in Sol space! Moons orbit their planets, and planets orbit the sun. You can use the gravity of planets to slingshot yourself around the universe.

### Mine Planets!

Land on planets and mine them. Use the resources you mine to create more astrochickens, or to improve your current astrochicken's speed, durability, mining rate, or armements.

### Race for resources!

Play against other players to see who can mine the most before the solar system is depleted. Or, write computer AI and have them play!

## Astrochicken 2: Galaxy

At conventional speeds, travelling the eons between solar systems would take longer than most humans live. To more distant suns, it could take millions. No human could make that journey. But an astrochicken does not age.

### Explore the whole galaxy!

### Mine, replicate, repeat!

### Watch life form, rise, and fall!

## Astrochicken 3: Universe
