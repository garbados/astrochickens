# Astrochickens

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/garbados/astrochickens.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/garbados/astrochickens)

A space exploration game of scale.

**This game is under heavy development, and many of the links in this readme are TODO. You have been warned!**

To play, just go [here][website]! You can play Astrochickens right in your browser.

## Overview

Explore a living galaxy!

You control an [astrochicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochicken) scooting about the galaxy. Initially, your ship is fragile, unarmed, and slower than the speed of light. By mining resources from planets, you can improve your ship, build more astrochickens, and colonize worlds.

Wander a galaxy rich in alien life in every stage of growth and decay, from fledgling species to mature spacefarers with astrochickens that swallow worlds. As eons pass, civilizations will rise and fall; for some, you may only ever encounter their remains.

Stars, too, age. Over millions of years, stars live and die, emitting catastrophic novas as they transform. Dying suns may consume whole civilizations, leaving not even their planets.

For more information, see the [tutorial][] and [reference][].
